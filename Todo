TODO list for Perl module Parse::File::Taxonomy

I.  Think about unifying PF::Taxonomy and PF::ExtractTaxonomy.  They're really
two different ways of describing the same structured data.  In the former --
which might be described as "taxonomy-by-path" -- the structure is described
by the contents of delimited strings in one designated column in each row.  In the latter
-- which might be described as "taxonomy-by-indexing" -- the structure is
described by (a) the primary key column; (b) the parent column; and (c) one
data column from which a taxonomy-by-path could be generated.

II.  Objectives:  Take a file in either format and be able to confirm that it
is a conformant taxonomy.  Be able to apply additional local validation rules.
Be able to determine whether a t-b-p is equivalent to a t-b-y.

III.  Be able to provide as input either a CSV file or a pair of Perl data
structures representing what you would get if you applied Text::CSV to the
file.  Namely, an array ref holding the column names, and a ref to an array of
array refs holding the data records of each row.
