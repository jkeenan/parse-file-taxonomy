TODO list for Perl module Parse::File::Taxonomy

II.  Objectives:  Take a file in either format and be able to confirm that it
is a conformant taxonomy.  Be able to determine whether a taxonomy-by-path is equivalent
to a taxonomy-by-index, and vice versa.  IN PROGRESS: Tested but not
documented, for index-to-path case.

IV.  What would it mean for a Parse::File::Taxonomy subclass to accept a
filehandle as an argument, rather than a file?  Would that be difficult to
implement?

VI.  Documentation of components interface to Parse::File::Taxonomy::Index.

VII.  Am using "component" is more than one way in this library.  Probably
confusing; simplify.
