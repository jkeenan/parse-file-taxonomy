TODO list for Perl module Parse::File::Taxonomy

II.  Objectives:  Take a file in either format and be able to confirm that it
is a conformant taxonomy.  Be able to apply additional local validation rules.
Be able to determine whether a t-b-p is equivalent to a t-b-y.

IV.  What would it mean for a Parse::File::Taxonomy subclass to accept a
filehandle as an argument, rather than a file?  Would that be difficult to
implement?

V.  The user of this library, however, must be permitted to write
B<additional user-specified validation rules> which will be applied to a
taxonomy by means of a C<local_validate()> method called on a
Parse::File::Taxonomy object.  Should the file fail to meet those rules, the
user may choose not to proceed further even though the taxonomy meets the
basic validation criteria implemented in the constructor.  This method will
take a reference to an array of subroutines references as its argument.  Each
such code reference will be a user-defined rule which the taxonomy must obey.
The method will apply each code reference to the taxonomy in sequence and will
return with a true value if and only if all the individual criteria return
true as well.  FUNCTIONALITY OVERKILL; removed.
