=head1 TODO for Parse-Taxonomy

TODO list for Perl module Parse::Taxonomy

=head2 Filehandle as argument

What would it mean for a Parse::Taxonomy subclass to accept a
filehandle as an argument, rather than a file?  Would that be difficult to
implement?

=head2 Data migration example

Cookbook:  Include recipe for predicting the result of a data migration
between relational database tables.

=head2 Nested Sets

=head3 Methods in existing packages

A method in Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath that would generate a Perl data
structure holding a taxonomy-by-nested-set equivalent to that in the object.

A method in Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList that would generate a Perl data
structure holding a taxonomy-by-nested-set equivalent to that in the object.

=head3 New package

Explore creation of a Parse::Taxonomy::NestedSet package which would
take as input a taxonomy-by-nested-set (via a CSV file or via a C<components>
interface), created a NestedSet object against which methods such as
C<descendant_counts()>, C<pathify()> and C<adjacentify()> would be callable.
