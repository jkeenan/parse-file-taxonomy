Parse::Taxonomy::Cookbook - cookbook for Parse-Taxonomy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is a cookbook holding usage examples -- recipes -- for various
F<Parse::Taxonomy> subclasses.

The documentation herein presumes that you have already studied the
documentation in F<Parse::Taxonomy>, F<Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath>,
F<Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList>, etc.

=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Validate a taxonomy-by-materialized-path

=head3 Problem

You have a CSV file which you have been told is a taxonomy-by-materialized-path.  You want to
confirm its validity.

Let's say the file holds these records:

    $> cat ./proposed_taxonomy.csv
    "path","vertical","is_actionable"
    "|Alpha","Auto",,"0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon|Kappa","Auto","0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon|Kappa","Auto","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta","Auto","0"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Lambda","Auto","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Mu","Auto","0"

=head3 Solution

Try to create a Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath object using the C<file> interface.

    local $@;
    eval {
        $self = Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath->new( {
            file => './proposed_taxonomy.csv',
        } );
    };
    print STDERR "$@\n";

If C<$self> is created successfully, the taxonomy meets the requirements
described in F<Parse::Taxonomy>.  This particular file, however, will throw
an exception.  Examination of the content of C<$@> will show that two records
have the same materialized path, i.e., the same value in the C<path> column.

=head2 Validate a taxonomy-by-adjacent-list

=head3 Problem

You have a CSV file which you have been told is a taxonomy-by-adjacent-list.  You want
to confirm its validity.

Let's say the file holds these records:

    $> cat ./proposed_taxonomy_by_index.csv
    "id","parent_id","name","vertical","is_actionable"
    "1","","Alpha","Auto","0"
    "2","1","Epsilon","Auto","0"
    "3","2","Kappa","Auto","1"
    "4","2","Kappa","Auto","1"
    "5","1","Zeta","Auto","0"
    "6","5","Lambda","Auto","1"
    "7","5","Mu","Auto","1"

=head3 Solution

Try to create a Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList object using the C<file> interface.

    local $@;
    eval {
        $self = Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList->new( {
            file => './proposed_taxonomy_by_index.csv',
        } );
    };
    print STDERR "$@\n";

If C<$self> is created successfully, the taxonomy meets the requirements
described in F<Parse::Taxonomy>.  This particular file, however, will throw
an exception.  Examination of the content of C<$@> will show that two records
with the same C<parent_id> have the same C<name>.

=head2 Apply extra validations to a taxonomy

=head3 Problem

You have a taxonomy file from which you have successfully created a
Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath object.  From that you know that it is valid with
respect to the requirements for a taxonomy imposed by this library.  But you
have additional business requirements which a taxonomy must fulfill before you
can use the taxonomy in production.

Suppose that you have a taxonomy file with this data:

    $> cat local_requirement.csv
    "path","is_actionable"
    "|Alpha","0"
    "|Beta","0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon","0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon|Kappa","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta","0"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Lambda","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Mu","0"
    "|Beta|Eta","1"
    "|Beta|Theta","1"
    "|Beta|Iota","0"

Suppose further that you have a business requirement that all nodes which are
"pure" leaf nodes -- all nodes which have no children of their own -- have a true value for C<is_actionable>.

=head3 Solution

Use Parse::Taxonomy:::Path accessor methods to get at the data in the taxonomy
and then write your own functions to conduct local validations.

In this case:

    $self = Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath->new( {
        file    => 'local_requirement.csv',
    } );
    $hashified       = $self->hashify();
    $child_counts    = $self->child_counts();

Use C<hashify()> to turn the taxonomy into a hash.  Use C<child_counts()> to
get the number of children each node has.  Then iterate over the hash checking
whether an element has no children and, if so, whether the node's
C<is_actionable> setting is true.

    @non_actionable_leaf_nodes = ();
    for my $node (keys %{$hashified}) {
        if (
            ($child_counts->{$node} == 0) &&
            (! $hashified->{$node}->{is_actionable})
        ) {
            push @non_actionable_leaf_nodes, $node;
        }
    }
    warn "leaf node '$_' is non-actionable"
        for @non_actionable_leaf_nodes;

Output will resemble:

    leaf node '|Alpha|Zeta|Mu' is non-actionable at ...
    leaf node '|Beta|Iota' is non-actionable at ...

You can then decide how to handle this per your business requirements.

=head2 Convert a taxonomy-by-materialized-path to a taxonomy-by-adjacent-list

=head3 Problem

You have a file which holds a validated taxonomy-by-materialized-path and you want to
create a file which holds the equivalent taxonomy-by-adjacent-list.

Suppose you have a file with this data:

    "path","is_actionable"
    "|Alpha","0"
    "|Beta","0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon","0"
    "|Alpha|Epsilon|Kappa","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta","0"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Lambda","1"
    "|Alpha|Zeta|Mu","1"
    "|Beta|Eta","1"
    "|Beta|Theta","1"
    "|Beta|Iota","1"

=head3 Solution

Use the C<adjacentify()> and C<write_adjacentified_to_csv()> methods.

    $adjacentified = $self->adjacentify();
    $file_taxonomy_by_index = $self->write_adjacentified_to_csv($adjacentified);

The file whose path is stored in C<$file_taxonomy_by_index> will look like
this:

    id,parent_id,name,is_actionable
    1,,Alpha,0
    2,,Beta,0
    3,1,Epsilon,0
    4,1,Zeta,0
    5,2,Eta,1
    6,2,Theta,1
    7,2,Iota,1
    8,3,Kappa,1
    9,4,Lambda,1
    10,4,Mu,1

=head2 Convert a taxonomy-by-adjacent-list to a taxonomy-by-materialized-path

=head3 Problem

In a relational database (RDB), you have hierarchical data stored in a flat table by
way of C<id>, C<parent_id> and C<name> columns.  You need to communicate the
current status of that taxonomy to someone who is familiar with CSV-formatted
data and who would like to see the structure in that taxonomy expressed in a
single column.

=head3 Solution

First you need to get the data out of the RDB and into a text file.  For that
you might use a command-line language appropriate for that in RDB.  For
example, in F<psql>, the command-line language associated with PostgreSQL, you
would say:

    $> \copy (SELECT id, parent_id, name, is actionable FROM my_table) TO /path/to/taxonomy.csv WITH CSV HEADERS

The CSV file would then contain data like this:

    "id","parent_id","name","is_actionable"
    "1","","Alpha","0"
    "2","","Beta","0"
    "3","1","Epsilon","0"
    "4","3","Kappa","1"
    "5","1","Zeta","0"
    "6","5","Lambda","1"
    "7","5","Mu","0"
    "8","2","Eta","1"
    "9","2","Theta","1"

First, create a Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList object from this source file, and then
apply the C<pathify()> method to it with the C<as_string> option set to a true
value.

    $source = "/path/to/taxonomy.csv";
    $self = Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList->new( {
        file    => $source,
    } );

    $rv = $self->pathify( { as_string => 1 } );

That returns a Perl reference to an array of array references:

    [
      ["path", "is_actionable"],
      ["|Alpha", 0],
      ["|Beta", 0],
      ["|Alpha|Epsilon", 0],
      ["|Alpha|Epsilon|Kappa", 1],
      ["|Alpha|Zeta", 0],
      ["|Alpha|Zeta|Lambda", 1],
      ["|Alpha|Zeta|Mu", 0],
      ["|Beta|Eta", 1],
      ["|Beta|Theta", 1],
    ]

=head2 Confirm that two taxonomies are equivalent

=head3 Problem

You have received a plain-text file which holds CSV-formatted records which
constitute a taxonomy-by-materialized-path.  You passed the file off to the staff member
with the "Big Data" t-shirt.  Big Data got the records inserted into an RDBMS
where the materialized path is represented by "pointers" to records higher up
in the taxonomy, I<i.e.,> by means of a C<parent_id> column.  You want to
demonstrate that the taxonomic structure present in the incoming file has been
correctly represented in the RDBMS.

Let's suppose that the data in the incoming taxonomy file looked like this:

    $> cat mu.csv

    "path","is_actionable"
    "--Alpha","0"
    "--Beta","0"
    "--Alpha--Epsilon","0"
    "--Alpha--Epsilon--Kappa","1"
    "--Alpha--Zeta","0"
    "--Alpha--Zeta--Lambda","1"
    "--Alpha--Zeta--Mu","0"
    "--Beta--Eta","1"
    "--Beta--Theta","1"

Let's further suppose that the data was inserted into the F<greeks> table in
the F<taxonomy> database:

    taxonomy=# SELECT * FROM greeks;
     id | parent_id |  name   | is_actionable
    ----+-----------+---------+---------------
      1 |           | Alpha   | f
      2 |           | Beta    | f
      3 |         1 | Epsilon | f
      4 |         3 | Kappa   | t
      5 |         1 | Zeta    | f
      6 |         5 | Lambda  | t
      7 |         5 | Mu      | f
      8 |         2 | Eta     | t
      9 |         2 | Theta   | t
    (9 rows)

How can we demonstrate that the data and the hierarchical structure implicit
in the table matches that of the original file?

=head3 Solution

Copy the database table (or the relevant rows) to a plain-text file in CSV
format.  In the case of PostgreSQL, that would look like this:

    \copy (SELECT * FROM greeks) TO '/path/to/taxonomy/greeks.csv' WITH CSV HEADER

Yielding:

    id,parent_id,name,is_actionable
    1,,Alpha,f
    2,,Beta,f
    3,1,Epsilon,f
    4,3,Kappa,t
    5,1,Zeta,f
    6,5,Lambda,t
    7,5,Mu,f
    8,2,Eta,t
    9,2,Theta,t

Create a Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList object using F<greeks.csv> as the source:

    $self = Parse::Taxonomy::AdjacentList->new( {
        file    => '/path/to/taxonomy/greeks.csv',
    } );

Call the C<pathify> method on the object.

    $pathified = $self->pathify;

If we were to dump C<$pathified>, we would see:

    $Data::Dump::pp($pathified);

    [
      ["path", "is_actionable"],
      [["", "Alpha"], "f"],
      [["", "Beta"], "f"],
      [["", "Alpha", "Epsilon"], "f"],
      [["", "Alpha", "Epsilon", "Kappa"], "t"],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta"], "f"],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta", "Lambda"], "t"],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta", "Mu"], "f"],
      [["", "Beta", "Eta"], "t"],
      [["", "Beta", "Theta"], "t"],
    ]

Now, there's one little tweak needed here.  In the original taxonomy file, the
C<is_actionable> column held Boolean data which represented C<TRUE> and
C<FALSE> by C<"1"> and C<"0">, respectively.  When this data was inserted into the database
(PostgreSQL, in this case), that Boolean data was stored as C<t> or C<f>,
which was also the way it was stored in the CSV file created by copying data
from the F<greeks> table.  We will need to rewrite the data in the
second (C<is_actionable>) column of the elements of C<$pathified> as C<1> or
C<0> to proceed with our test for equivalence.

    $fields = $pathified->[0];
    @data_records = ();
    for $rec (@{$pathified}[1..$#{$pathified}]) {
        $bool = ($rec->[1] eq 't') ? 1 : 0;
        push @data_records, [
            join('|' => @{$rec->[0]}),
            ($rec->[1] eq 't') ? 1 : 0,
        ];
    }

We're now in a position to create a B<new> Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath object based
on the data extracted from the database via the CSV file.  We'll use the
C<components> interface to C<Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath::new()> because our
taxonomy now lives in the form of Perl data structures suitable for the
C<components> interface.

    $ptpobj = Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath->new( {
        components  => {
            fields          => $fields,
            data_records    => \@data_records,
        },
    } );

We'll now call the C<fields_and_data_records_path_components()> method on the
object.  This method returns an array of array references in which the first
element is an array reference holding the column names and in which, in all
subsequent elements, the first element is itself a reference to an array
holding the components of the materialized path.

    $fdr1 = $ptpobj->fields_and_data_records_path_components;

Which, when dumped, gives:

    [
      ["path", "is_actionable"],
      [["", "Alpha"], 0],
      [["", "Beta"], 0],
      [["", "Alpha", "Epsilon"], 0],
      [["", "Alpha", "Epsilon", "Kappa"], 1],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta"], 0],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta", "Lambda"], 1],
      [["", "Alpha", "Zeta", "Mu"], 0],
      [["", "Beta", "Eta"], 1],
      [["", "Beta", "Theta"], 1],
    ]

We now return to the original incoming taxonomy file, which we use as the
source for a second Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath object.  Remember that C<--> was
used to separate the parts of the materialized path in that file.

    $tax = Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath->new( {
        file => '/path/to/mu.csv,
        path_col_sep => '--',
    } );

We now call the C<fields_and_data_records_path_components()> method on this
object as well.

    $fdr2 = $tax->fields_and_data_records_path_components;

Finally, we feed C<$fdr1> and C<$fdr2> to C<Test::More::is_deeply()>.

    is_deeply($fdr1, $fdr2, "QED");

If this function returns true -- which it does -- then the taxonomy implicit
in the F<greeks> table in the database is equivalent to that in the original
incoming taxonomy file.

=head2 Create taxonomically correct dummy data

=head3 Problem

You have a database table with views built on top of it.  The data in the
table is hierarchical in nature and is structured as a
taxonomy-by-adjacent-list.  You want to explore alternative definitions of the
views. While conducting your research, however, you do not want to touch
production data.  Hence, you want to create a dummy table and load suitable
dummy data into it.  You know how to load a table from a CSV file and want to
correctly populate that CSV file with hierarchical data.

=head3 Solution

Let's assume that you want to populate the table with three columns of data:

    @input_columns = ( qw| path  letter_vendor_id  is_actionable |);

In PostgreSQL, the table might be defined like this:

                          Table "public.letters"
          Column      |         Type          |       Modifiers        
    ------------------+-----------------------+------------------------
     id               | integer               | not null
     parent_id        | integer               | 
     name             | character varying(16) | not null
     letter_vendor_id | integer               | not null
     is_actionable    | boolean               | not null default false
    Indexes:
        "letters_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    Foreign-key constraints:
        "letters_letter_vendor_id_fkey"
            FOREIGN KEY (letter_vendor_id) REFERENCES letter_vendors(id)
        "letters_parent_id_fkey"
            FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES letters(id)
    Referenced by:
        TABLE "letters" CONSTRAINT "letters_parent_id_fkey"
            FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES letters(id)

The C<path> column holds a materialized path starting with the name of a root
node, proceeding through the names of branch nodes and ending with the name of
a leaf node.  All the names are concatenated with a delimiter string.  Example:

    omega - joyride - Africa

From this we infer that there is a root node named C<omega>, a branch node
named C<joyride> and a leaf node named C<Africa>.

To make the data somewhat more realistic, we'll say that C<letter_vendor_id>
points to the C<id> column of a C<letter_vendors> table.

    hierarchy=# SELECT * FROM letter_vendors;
     id |  name  | namespace_code 
    ----+--------+----------------
      1 | Athens | at
      2 | Sparta | sp
      3 | Thebes | th
    (3 rows)

As we create nodes, we'll sprinkle various C<letter_vendor_ids> among them.

For another dollop of realism, we'll say that only 3-level nodes -- rows whose
C<path> column have 3 elements will be assigned a C<TRUE> value for
C<is_actionable>.  Nodes with only 1 or 2 elements will have C<FALSE> assigned
to C<is_actionable>.

Let's say that there will be 24 top-level nodes:  one for each letter in the
Classical Greek alphabet.

    @toplevels = ( qw|
        alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta eta theta
        iota kappa lamda mu nu xi omicron pi
        rho sigma tau upsilon phi chi psi omega
    | );

Under each of the top-level nodes will be 10 second-level nodes.  To
illustrate an unusual but important edge case, we'll name these second-level
nodes exactly the same under each of the 24 top-level nodes.

    @seconds = ( qw|
        able baker charlie dogtag entry
        fargo golfer hiphop icicle joyride
    | );

Under each of the second-level nodes will be 100 third-level nodes.
Continuing along the same path as above, we'll named these third-level nodes
exactly the same under each of the 240 (24 x 10) second-level nodes.

    @thirds = (
        "AOL", "Aachen", "Aaliyah", "Aaron", "Abbas",
        # ...
        "Agatha", "Aggie", "Aglaia", "Agnes", "Agnew",
    );

(A list extracted from F</usr/share/dict/words>; you can find the complete
list in F<examples/create_letters_taxonomy.pl> in this distribution.)

As promised, we'll distribute C<letter_vendor_ids> among the nodes as we
create an array of data records with which we'll populate our database table.

    my %toplevels_to_lvis = (
        ( map { $_ => 1 } @toplevels[0..7]),
        ( map { $_ => 2 } @toplevels[8..15]),
        ( map { $_ => 3 } @toplevels[16..23]),
    );

    my @data_records;
    for my $r (@toplevels) {
        push @data_records, [ join('|' => ('', $r)), $toplevels_to_lvis{$r}, 0 ];
        for my $s (@seconds) {
            push @data_records, [ join('|' => ('', $r, $s)), $toplevels_to_lvis{$r}, 0 ];
            for my $t (@thirds) {
                push @data_records, [ join('|' => ('', $r, $s, $t)), $toplevels_to_lvis{$r}, 1 ];
            }
        }
    }

We expect to have 24,264 elements in the list of data records:  24 for
top-level nodes, 240 for second-level nodes and 24,000 for third-level nodes.

Between C<@input_columns> and C<@data_records> we have all the data we need to
create a Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath using the C<components> interface
to that class's constructor.

    my $self = Parse::Taxonomy::MaterializedPath->new( {
        components  => {
            fields          => [ @input_columns ],
            data_records    => [ @data_records  ],
        },
        path_col_sep => '|',
    } );

If C<$self> is C<defined>, then we have a data structure in memory which is
validated as a taxonomy -- in this case, a taxonomy-by-materialized-path.
We're now in a position to call the C<adjacentify()> method to transform that
taxonomy-by-materialized-path into a taxonomy-by-adjacent-list.

    my $adjacentified = $self->adjacentify();

And the next step is to write that data structure out to a new CSV file
suitable for loading into the C<letters> table in our database.

    my $csv_file = $self->write_adjacentified_to_csv( {
        adjacentified => $adjacentified,
        csvfile => './letters.csv',
    } );

Here is a peek at the contents of F<./letters.csv>:

    id,parent_id,name,letter_vendor_id,is_actionable
    1,,alpha,1,0
    2,,beta,1,0
    3,,gamma,1,0
    4,,delta,1,0
    5,,epsilon,1,0
    6,,zeta,1,0
    7,,eta,1,0
    8,,theta,1,0
    ...
    23,,psi,3,0
    24,,omega,3,0
    25,1,able,1,0
    26,1,baker,1,0
    27,1,charlie,1,0
    28,1,dogtag,1,0
    29,1,entry,1,0
    30,1,fargo,1,0
    ...
    263,24,icicle,3,0
    264,24,joyride,3,0
    265,25,AOL,1,1
    266,25,Aachen,1,1
    267,25,Aaliyah,1,1
    268,25,Aaron,1,1
    269,25,Abbas,1,1
    270,25,Abbasid,1,1
    ...
    24257,264,Agamemnon,3,1
    24258,264,Agassi,3,1
    24259,264,Agassiz,3,1
    24260,264,Agatha,3,1
    24261,264,Aggie,3,1
    24262,264,Aglaia,3,1
    24263,264,Agnes,3,1
    24264,264,Agnew,3,1

And finally, here's how we would populate our database table (in PostgreSQL):

    \copy letters (id,parent_id,name,letter_vendor_id,is_actionable) FROM './letters.csv' CSV HEADER
